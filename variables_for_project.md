# Data Science Project Variables for Google Colab

## Sensor Data

- Event location
- Event depth
- Time of occurrence

## CO2 Injection Data

- Amount of CO2 injected
- Timing of injections
- Location of injection sites

## Seismic Activity Metrics

- Magnitude of events
- Frequency of events
- Type of seismic activity (micro-seismic vs. larger events)

## Well Operation Data

- Pressure readings (up to 2000 psi)
- Water injection volumes
- CO2 injection volumes

## Environmental Impact

- Amount of CO2 left in the ground
- Comparison of CO2 levels before and after injection

## Economic Factors

- Cost of CO2 acquisition
- Tax credits received for CO2 sequestration

## Temporal Analysis

- Changes in seismic activity over time
- Correlation between injection activities and seismic events

## Spatial Analysis

- Distribution of seismic events relative to injection sites
- Triangulation of seismic activity sources

## Comparative Analysis

- Differences between water and CO2 injection effects
- Variations in seismic activity across different injection locations

## Regulatory Compliance

- Adherence to EPA requirements for monitoring
- Documentation of CO2 sequestration for reporting purposes

## Google Colab Considerations

- Session timeouts (typically 12 hours)
- Resource constraints (RAM, GPU availability)
- Integration with Google Drive for data storage
- Collaboration features for sharing notebooks

Given these variables and considerations, potential analyses in Google Colab could include:

1. Time series analysis of seismic activity
2. Spatial mapping of events and injection sites
3. Correlation studies between injection activities and seismic events
4. Machine learning models to predict seismic activity based on injection parameters
5. Visualization of trends and patterns in the data
